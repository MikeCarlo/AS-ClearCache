# Functions

The Clear Cache external tool enables a desktop user to clear the Cache of the locally running AS model. For more details on this please refer to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/instances/clear-the-analysis-services-caches?view=asallproducts-allversions). 

# Requirements

This external tool requires the SQLSever PowerShell module to be installed. If your machine does not have this installed the External tool will attempt to install this module.  

If the external tool fails to install the PowerShell module you can manually install it from here: [PowerShell Gallery SQL Server](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer/21.0.17099)
